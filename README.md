# File Organizer Pro

A simple but powerful utility to automatically organize the files in a directory into clean, type-based subfolders.

## What It Does

This script scans a target folder (like your `Downloads` directory) and moves files into subfolders based on their file type.

- `document.pdf` -> `PDF Files/`
- `photo.jpg` -> `JPG Files/`
- `archive.zip` -> `ZIP Files/`
- ...and so on!

## Features

-   **Easy-to-Use Interface**: A simple and clean graphical user interface (GUI).
-   **Standalone Executables**: No need to install Python or any other dependencies. Just download and run.
-   **Smart Conflict Resolution**: Automatically renames files if a file with the same name already exists in the destination.
-   **Convenient**: Defaults to your "Downloads" folder on first launch.
-   **Accessible**: Features adjustable font sizes (Small, Medium, Large).
