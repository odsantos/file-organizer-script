    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>File Organizer is primarily a client-side application, and the website itself collects minimal information. We may collect non-personally identifiable information through standard web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand website traffic and usage patterns. This data helps us improve the website and user experience. We do NOT collect personal information such as your name, email address, or payment details directly through the application or this website, unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., via the contact form).</p>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Any non-personally identifiable information collected (e.g., through web analytics) is used solely to analyze website performance, understand user behavior, and improve the content and functionality of the File Organizer website. If you voluntarily provide personal information (e.g., via our contact form), it will be used only for the purpose for which it was provided, such as responding to your inquiries. We do not use your information for marketing purposes without your explicit consent, and we never sell or rent your data to third parties.</p>
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect any information collected against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
